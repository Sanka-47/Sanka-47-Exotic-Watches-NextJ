  A Watch Selling Website - Built with Next.js & Prisma.ðŸš€
Building this watch-selling platform has been an exciting journey! I developed a sleek and modern e-commerce website where users can explore and purchase premium watches. The admin dashboard provides complete control over product management, ensuring a seamless experience for administrators.

Key Features:
 âœ… Next.js 15-powered 
 âœ… Secure authentication with NextAuth (Google Auth)
 âœ… Prisma ORM for efficient database management
 âœ… Cloudinary integration for optimized image storage
 âœ… Stripe Payment Gateway
 âœ… shadcn Charts
 âœ… Responsive & user-friendly UI for a smooth shopping experience

This project helped me enhance my skills in full-stack development, database management, and cloud integration. Looking forward to improving it further! ðŸš€
